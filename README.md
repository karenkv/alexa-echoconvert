# Amazon Alexa Skill: Binary and Decimal Converter

## Setup

- Create an Amazon account:
  - Visit https://amazon.com/ and create one, no credit card necessary
- Create an AWS account:
  - Visit https://aws.amazon.com/ to do so
  - This one does require a credit card, but Amazon won't charge you
  - Note: This takes up to 24 hours for the account to activate
  - We will be using AWS Lambda to create the Alexa Skill
- Create an Amazon developer account:
  - Go to https://developer.amazon.com and link it to your Amazon account
- Download and install a text editor
  - I use GitHub's open source text editor, Atom. You can download it at https://atom.io/
  - Other text editors I recommend are Sublime (https://www.sublimetext.com/) or VIM, but an text editor works
- Clone/download this repository
  - This comes with the template that we will be using to create the functions running Alexa, as well as the completed version
  - The sample code included to start our project is referenced from the Alexa 101 workshop (https://wrkshp.github.io/alexa/)
  - Note: We will be writing in Python 3.6
